# Governance

olore is an open source project with a community-first mindset and a small maintainer core.

## Roles

**Maintainers**
- Review and merge pull requests
- Cut releases and publish packages
- Set technical direction and resolve disputes

**Contributors**
- Propose changes via issues and pull requests
- Help curate and build documentation packages
- Improve tooling, docs, and examples

## Decision Making

We aim for consensus in issues and PRs. If consensus cannot be reached, a maintainer makes the final decision after considering feedback.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Active contributors who consistently improve the project can be invited as maintainers. The current maintainers decide by consensus.

## Security and Responsible Disclosure

Report security issues privately via the project contact email listed in the README.

## Changes to This Document
