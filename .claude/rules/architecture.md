# Architecture Workflow

**@docs/architecture.md is the source of truth** for system design, package format, registry, and install flow.

Before changes affecting package structure, CLI commands, registry, or agent integration:

1. **Read first** — Consult @docs/architecture.md
2. **Update docs first** — Update @docs/architecture.md before implementing
3. **Record decisions** — Add an ADR to @docs/adr/README.md following the existing format
