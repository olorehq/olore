# LangChain Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for LangChain and LangGraph frameworks. Covers building LLM applications, agents, and stateful workflows in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Entry Point |
|------|-------------|
| Learning resources | `contents/learn.mdx` |
| LangChain quickstart | `contents/langchain/quickstart.mdx` |
| LangGraph quickstart | `contents/langgraph/quickstart.mdx` |
| Python integrations | `contents/python/integrations/` |
| JavaScript integrations | `contents/javascript/integrations/` |
| Building agents | `contents/langchain/agents.mdx` |
| Common errors | `contents/common-errors.mdx` |
| Migration guides | `contents/python/migrate/` or `contents/javascript/migrate/` |

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks about:
- Building LLM applications with LangChain
- Creating agents and multi-agent systems
- Building stateful workflows with LangGraph
- Integrating with chat models, embeddings, vector stores, and tools
- Python or JavaScript/TypeScript implementations
- Prompt engineering, context management, and structured outputs
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns
- Memory management and state persistence
- Middleware, guardrails, and observability
- Deploying LangChain applications

## How to find information

1. **First**, read `TOC.md` for complete file listing organized by directory
2. Choose the appropriate language section (`python/` or `javascript/`)
3. Pick the framework (`langchain/` for core, `langgraph/` for stateful workflows)
4. Navigate to specific integrations, guides, or API references

**TOC.md contains all 1700+ files organized by directory - always check it first.**

## Documentation Organization
